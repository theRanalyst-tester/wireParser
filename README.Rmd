#### Overview
The wireParser app is an attempt at automating the scheduling of financial wire transfer documents that are received when a bank or other financial instutition is subpoenaed. An analyst can take hours, or even days, to enter all of the data from these documents in an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. With this tool, that scheduling happens almost instantly, which allows more time for actual analysis. 

#### How to Use the App
**First and foremost, you need to have R and RStudio installed. If you do not have these things installed, please Google how to do this. In addition, you will need to install poppler utils. You can Google "pdftotext" to find a file from which to download.**

Using this tool is very straightforward, you simply need to call the `parseWireData()` function and pass it three arguments: `file`, `bank`, and `format`. The `file` argument tells R which file you'd like to parse, `bank` indicates the bank from which the file came, and `format` indicates the file type (i.e., xlsx, pdf, or csv). Once the app is finished parsing the file, a `data.frame` object is returned with the relevant information from the document. In the future, I'll be looking to add a spreadsheet with every known bank geocoded, both national and international. This will allow the app to automatically geolocate any and all banks involved, which will allow the analyst to map the flow of funds.

One thing to keep in mind when using the tool: any bank that sends an Excel file (xls or xlsx) will invariably add some formatting to their spreadsheets. This will included merged headers, colored cells, etc. The app will try its best to remove these formatting options, but it might be best if you remove them yourself.

#### Shortcomings

Currently the app can only handle Bank of America PDF files. I'm currently working on BNY Mellon, and as bank functionality is added, the files here will be updated. If you have any issues, please be sure to issue them [here](https://github.com/theRanalyst/wireParser/issues).
